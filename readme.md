# Blazor.InvoiceDemo

**This is work in progress code and documents.**

This is the latest latest version of my development framework and changes on a daily basis.

It's purpose is to demonstrate one way of developing a Blazor database application.

You're welcome to use any of my code, and comment critically on what I've done.

The code is opinionated in certain areas:

1. I use a different set of base components.  I'm not a fan of using `ComponentBase` as a one size fits all component.
2. I use Entity Framework purely as an ORM: I don't manage complex objects in EF.
